## Website Purpose

**_The problem_**

Personal finance is often not a priority in the lives of many. This can be due to a number of reasons including lack of financial literacy, the time involvement of tracking expenses or the intimidation factor due to the overwhelming amount of finance advice available. When it comes to personal finance, often simple is better and by being able to track your spending habits over time it is possible to improve your financial position.

**_Our solution_**

Our web app aims to solve this problem by providing a straight forward and intuitive interface for tracking expenses to help our users stay under budget and reach their savings goals.

**_Motivation_**

- Help our users better understand their finances
- Increase their financial position
- Help our users track their expenses
- Help our users to reach their savings goals
- Give our users more control over their finances
- Motivate our users to form good financial habits
- Help our users to save time

**_Implementation_**

Our apps purpose will be achieved by focusing on three different areas: **financial literacy, time savings/convenience and by helping to motivate our users**. This is accomplished in a number of ways:

1. Enable users to save time - the app will utilise simple and easy-to-use interfaces for navigation. It will provide graphical statistics and data visualisations for quick overview. This will save our users from having to laboriously fill out spread sheets or perform calculations to analyse their habits.

2. Increase financial literacy in our users over time - the app will provide daily finance tips in a short and accessible format.

3. Instil motivation to self-manage and improve finances - our app will include a social feed which will allow users to share their progress towards a goal with trusted friends so that they have an incentive to stay on track. This will be supplemented with customizable notifications so that users can be kept updated on their progress and can adjust their spending as necessary.

## Dataflow Diagram

In the web application, the data flow can be visualised at 3 levels. At the top level (Level 0, Figure 1) is an overview of data interaction between the external entity, ie., users and the web application processing system. The next level (Level 1, Figure 2) shows a further breakdown of the processing system. Finally, Level 2 (Figure 3) provides a more detailed look at each subprocesses shown at level 1.
